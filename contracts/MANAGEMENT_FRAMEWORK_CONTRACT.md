# Management Framework — Shared Cross-Package Contract

**Version:** 1.2.0
**Date:** 2026-06-17
**Author:** Maheri
**Authored under:** `#persona-process-designer` (lead) + `#persona-compliance-governance` (support)
**Status:** ADOPTED — multi-project amendments added (v1.2.0, 2026-06-17); see the v1.2.0 note below and `OUTPUT_AND_STATE_CONTRACT.md`

> **Approval record (2026-06-10):** Shared-spine direction approved (Q1);  override via corrective  approved (Q2); phase-code set expanded to match the reshaped family (Q3 — see §5); default location = project root `management_framework/` with user override (Q4). Corrective **** added 2026-06-10 (Plan 2.1); templates follow in Plan Phase 2.1.
>
> **v1.1.0 amendment (2026-06-10, Plan 2.1 Step 1b):** §5 contributor set widened per user decision "do for all" — **AI-ILC** added as contributor (previously excluded); **AI-GCE** and **AI-TGE** promoted from "optional" to "contributor." PPM/FLO remain excluded (structural). §10 impact list updated accordingly.
>
> **v1.2.0 amendment (2026-06-17 — multi-project):** Reconciled with `OUTPUT_AND_STATE_CONTRACT.md`. Three changes: **(1)** in multi-project mode "project root" = `projects/PRJ-{ABBREV}-{slug}/`, so the spine lives at `projects/PRJ-{ABBREV}-{slug}/management_framework/`; **(2)** spine entry IDs become **project-qualified** — `{PHASE}-{ABBREV}-{TYPE}-{N}` (e.g. `PILC-XYZ-D-1`) instead of `{PHASE}-{TYPE}-{NNN}` — so multiple projects in one workspace never collide; **(3)** the spine is **carried forward** into the generated dev workspace at the AI-DWG hinge (§8). The new contract is the source of truth for the `projects/` layout; this contract governs spine content and contribution behavior within it.
>
> **Amendment (2026-06-22 — family-workspace prefix):** Per the install-lock design, the family's runtime areas now nest under `pdlc-ws/`. "Project root" is therefore `pdlc-ws/projects/PRJ-{ABBREV}-{slug}/` and the spine lives at `pdlc-ws/projects/PRJ-{ABBREV}-{slug}/management_framework/`. Spine ID formats are unchanged — only paths gain the `pdlc-ws/` prefix. (All `projects/PRJ-…/` references in the body below now carry this prefix.)

---

## 1. Purpose

The `management_framework/` is the project's **governance spine** — the auditable trail of decisions, changes, issues, and lessons captured as a project moves through the AI-* Family chain.

Historically each package produced its own `management_framework/` under its own output folder (AI-PILC under `{pilc-output}/`, AI-ADLC under `{adlc-output}/management_framework/`, AI-DWG under `{project-root}/management_framework/`). That fragments the record: a single `Decision_Log` ends up in three places, and answering "what was decided on this project?" means reading three folders.

This contract defines a **single consolidated governance spine per project** that every chain package *contributes to* — without coupling the packages or breaking standalone use.

> **This is a shared CONTRACT, not a new package.** No package "owns" or "manages" the others. The spine is a shared artifact each package appends to. Cross-project / portfolio governance (managing *many* projects, or governing the package set) is out of scope here — that is AI-PPM (portfolio) and AI-GCE (runtime compliance) territory.

---

## 2. Relationship to  (Important)

 ("Each Package Owns Its Own Governance Registers") states: *no shared/global management framework — each phase owns its tracking.* This contract **deliberately evolves that position**, the way  corrected.

's rationale was sound; this contract preserves its *intent* by other means:

|  concern | How this contract honors it |
|---|---|
| **Clean ownership** (PM decisions don't mix with dev decisions) | Every entry carries a mandatory **Phase** column and a **phase-prefixed ID** (`PILC-D-001`, `ADLC-C-002`, `DWG-I-003`). Ownership is encoded in the row itself, not the folder. |
| **Audit trail per phase** | The Phase column makes the log filterable per phase; chronological-across-phases is now *also* possible (a strict improvement). |
| **Self-contained output** | In **standalone mode**, each package still produces its own self-contained spine. Consolidation only happens in **chain mode**, when a spine already exists. |
| **Know which phase by looking** | The phase-prefixed ID answers this at the row level — stronger than "by which folder it's in." |

**Note:** In chain mode, this shared-spine contract supersedes the earlier per-package-registers approach (⇄, cross-linked both ways).

---

## 3. Detection by Marker

The spine is detected by **marker**, never by hardcoded path. The user chooses WHERE the spine lives; this contract defines WHAT must exist there.

| Element | Value |
|---|---|
| **Folder** | `management_framework/` (user may place at project root or a chosen governance folder) — in **multi-project mode** the project root is `pdlc-ws/projects/PRJ-{ABBREV}-{slug}/`, so the spine lives at `pdlc-ws/projects/PRJ-{ABBREV}-{slug}/management_framework/` |
| **Marker file** | `MANAGEMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` (the spine index/README — its presence means "a consolidated spine already exists here") |
| **Detection strategy** | User provides path → scan common locations (`./management_framework/`, project root, `pdlc-ws/projects/*/management_framework/`, predecessor output folder) → ask user |

**Marker registry addition** (to sit alongside the package markers per):

```
Shared management framework marker: management_framework/MANAGEMENT_FRAMEWORK.md
```

---

## 4. Contribution Behavior — Append-if-Exists, Create-if-Absent

Every chain package follows the same rule when it reaches a stage that records governance:

```
1. Detect the spine (by marker — Section 3).
2. IF a spine exists (MANAGEMENT_FRAMEWORK.md found):
      → APPEND this phase's entries to the existing registers.
      → Use this phase's project-qualified ID prefix (`{PHASE}-{ABBREV}-{TYPE}-{N}`) so IDs never collide — across phases OR across projects.
      → Register the phase in the index's "Contributing Phases" table.
3. IF no spine exists:
      → CREATE management_framework/ with the marker + this phase's registers.
      → The package operates exactly as it did standalone.
```

This keeps every package **independently runnable** (, graceful standalone) while producing one consolidated record whenever the chain is run end to end.

**Append is additive and non-destructive.** A package NEVER edits or deletes another phase's rows. It only adds its own.

---

## 5. Register Set

The consolidated spine carries up to six registers. Four are **universal** (every phase may write to them); two are **PILC-origin** (initiation governance) but remain available to any phase.

| Register | File | Universal? | ID type |
|---|---|:---:|---|
| Decision Log | `Decision_Log.md` | ✅ Universal | `{PHASE}-{ABBREV}-D-{N}` |
| Change Log | `Change_Log.md` | ✅ Universal | `{PHASE}-{ABBREV}-C-{N}` |
| Issue Log | `Issue_Log.md` | ✅ Universal | `{PHASE}-{ABBREV}-I-{N}` |
| Lessons Learned | `Lessons_Learned.md` | ✅ Universal | `{PHASE}-{ABBREV}-L-{N}` |
| Action Items | `Action_Items.md` | PILC-origin | `{PHASE}-{ABBREV}-A-{N}` |
| Assumptions & Dependencies | `Assumptions_Dependencies.md` | PILC-origin | `{PHASE}-{ABBREV}-AD-{N}` |

> **ID format (v1.2.0):** entry IDs are **project-qualified** — `{PHASE}-{ABBREV}-{TYPE}-{N}`, where `{ABBREV}` is the project handle from `PRJ-{ABBREV}-{slug}` (e.g. `PILC-XYZ-D-1`, `ADLC-XYZ-C-2`). In a legacy single-project layout the pre-v1.2.0 form `{PHASE}-{TYPE}-{NNN}` (e.g. `PILC-D-001`) remains valid for existing records — do not renumber them (/ non-destructive).

**Phase codes (amended 2026-06-10, Plan 2.1 Step 1b — "do for all"):**

The spine is **per-project**. All **project-touching** packages contribute:

| Phase code | Package | Contribution |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| `ILC`  | AI-ILC  | **Contributor** — idea-stage decisions (e.g. "approved idea", "rejected idea") seed the spine at the earliest point; PILC continues from there |
| `PILC` | AI-PILC | **Required** producer — full PMO governance (6 registers: Decision, Change, Issue, Action, Assumptions, Lessons) |
| `ADLC` | AI-ADLC | **Required** producer — architecture governance (4 registers: Decision, Change, Issue, Lessons) + ADRs remain separate |
| `POLC`  | AI-POLC  | **Required** producer (new build, Phase 4.1) — product-ownership governance |
| `DWG`  | AI-DWG  | **Required** producer — workspace generation governance (4 registers: Decision, Change, Issue, Lessons) |
| `UXD`  | AI-UXD  | **Required** producer (new build, Phase 4.1) — UX-design governance (design decisions, accessibility baseline decisions) |
| `GCE`  | AI-GCE  | **Contributor** — logs compliance-governance decisions (e.g. "baseline this violation", "tier activated") to the spine; primary compliance log (`.governance/compliance-log/`) remains the detailed operational record |
| `TGE`  | AI-TGE  | **Contributor** — logs test-governance decisions (e.g. "override test requirement", "risk acceptance") to the spine; primary test record (`.tge/`) remains the detailed operational record |

**Excluded from the per-project spine (structural — not oversight):**
- `PPM` (AI-PPM) — portfolio-scope (governs *many* projects); has its own portfolio register. Putting portfolio data in a per-project spine conflates scopes.
- `FLO` (AI-FLO) — routing infrastructure; produces no per-project governance records (it carries position, does not decide).

A package only creates the register files it actually writes to. The four universal registers exist in any spine; the two PILC-origin registers exist only if a phase that uses them has run.

---

## 6. Register Schemas

Every register adds a **Phase** column to the existing per-package schema. Columns are otherwise unchanged from the current templates, so existing package output stays compatible.

### Decision_Log.md
```markdown
| ID | Phase | Date | Decision | Context | Options Considered | Chosen | Rationale | Made By |
|----|-------|------|----------|---------|--------------------|--------|-----------|---------|
| PILC-XYZ-D-1 | PILC | | | | | | | |
```

### Change_Log.md

```

### Numbering Protocol — Determining `{N}`

When appending a new entry to any register, the contributing package MUST determine the next sequence number `{N}` as follows:

1. **Scan** the target register file for all existing entries matching the same phase and project prefix (e.g., all `ADLC-XYZ-D-*` entries in `Decision_Log.md`).
2. **Find the maximum** `{N}` currently used in that prefix group.
3. **Increment by 1** — the new entry gets `max + 1`.
4. **If no entries exist** for this prefix → start at `1`.

**Rules:**
- Never hardcode a starting number. Always scan for the current max.
- Never reuse or recycle deleted/removed IDs (non-destructive).
- The scan is scoped to `{PHASE}-{ABBREV}-{TYPE}-*` — different phases and different projects have independent counters.
- In brownfield (existing legacy entries with the pre-v1.2.0 format `{PHASE}-{TYPE}-{NNN}`), scan both formats and take the highest `N` across either format for that phase+type combination.

## 7. The Index File (Marker)

`MANAGEMENT_FRAMEWORK.md` is both the marker and the human entry point to the spine.

```markdown
<!-- Shared governance spine | contract v1.0.0 -->

# Management Framework

Consolidated governance spine for this project. Each phase of the AI-* chain
appends its decisions, changes, issues, and lessons here, tagged by phase.

## Registers
| Register | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Decision_Log.md | Decisions below formal-artifact threshold |
| Change_Log.md | Scope / approach / timeline changes |
| Issue_Log.md | Blockers and problems |
| Lessons_Learned.md | Insights to carry forward |
| Action_Items.md | Tracked follow-ups (if used) |
| Assumptions_Dependencies.md | Assumptions & dependencies (if used) |

## Contributing Phases
| Phase | Package | First Contributed | Registers Touched |
|-------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| PILC | AI-PILC | {date} | Decision, Change, Issue, Action, Assumptions, Lessons |

## Conventions
- Entry IDs are project-qualified, phase-prefixed: `{PHASE}-{ABBREV}-{TYPE}-{N}`.
- Entries are append-only — never edit or delete another phase's rows.
- Filter by the Phase column to view a single phase's governance.
```

When a package appends, it also adds its row to **Contributing Phases**.

---

## 8. ID Assignment Protocol (Numbering — OI-031)

Entry IDs use the format `{PHASE}-{ABBREV}-{TYPE}-{N}` where `{N}` is a sequential integer assigned per the protocol below. This prevents intra-phase ID collision (two entries within the same phase+project+type getting the same number).

### Assignment Rule

```
1. READ the target register file (e.g. Decision_Log.md).
2. SCAN all existing rows matching this phase+project+type prefix ({PHASE}-{ABBREV}-{TYPE}-*).
3. FIND the highest {N} value currently present for that prefix.
4. ASSIGN {N} = highest + 1 (or 1 if no existing entries for this prefix).
5. WRITE the new entry with the assigned ID.
```

### Concurrency Model

The AI-* Family operates in a **single-user, single-agent model**. Under this model, only one writer operates on a given register at any time. The scan-and-increment protocol is therefore safe — no two writes can race.

If a future version introduces parallelism (multiple agents writing the same register concurrently), a reservation or locking mechanism would be required. That is **explicitly deferred** — it will be addressed if and when the concurrency model changes.

### Carry-Forward Continuity

When a spine is carried forward into a dev workspace at the AI-DWG hinge (§9), numbering **continues** from the last assigned `{N}` in the carried-forward copy. It never resets to 1. The carried-forward spine already contains planning-side entries (e.g. `PILC-XYZ-D-1..5`); dev-workspace packages (DWG/GCE/TGE) start their own phase prefixes at 1 (since those phases haven't written yet), but if a phase already has entries in the carried-forward copy, they increment from the highest existing value.

### Brownfield

When overlaying a non-conforming `management_framework/` (no phase-prefixed IDs), existing entries are **never renumbered**. The package begins its own `{PHASE}-{ABBREV}-{TYPE}-1` alongside any legacy entries. Legacy entries remain as-is (non-destructive).

### Summary

| Scenario | How {N} is determined |
|----------|----------------------|
| Fresh spine (create) | Starts at 1 |
| Appending to existing spine (chain) | Scan → highest + 1 |
| Carried-forward spine (DWG hinge) | Scan → highest + 1 (continues) |
| Brownfield (legacy entries present) | Ignore legacy IDs; phase prefix starts at 1 |
| Same phase, multiple registers | Each register type has its own counter (D, C, I, L, A, AD are independent) |

---

## 9. Standalone vs. Chain Behavior

| Mode | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Standalone** (package run alone) | No spine exists → package creates `management_framework/` with its own registers, exactly as today. Self-contained (honors  intent). |
| **Chain** (predecessor already produced a spine) | Spine exists → package appends its phase entries to the shared registers and registers itself in the index. One consolidated record. |
| **Brownfield** | If a non-conforming `management_framework/` already exists, treat it as standalone-with-baseline: add the marker + Phase columns non-destructively, do not renumber existing human entries. |
| **Multi-project** (v1.2.0) | The spine lives at `pdlc-ws/projects/PRJ-{ABBREV}-{slug}/management_framework/` — one spine per project. Entry IDs carry the project handle (`{PHASE}-{ABBREV}-{TYPE}-{N}`) so projects never collide in one workspace. See `OUTPUT_AND_STATE_CONTRACT.md`. |
| **Carry-forward at the DWG hinge** (v1.2.0, Option A) | When AI-DWG generates a project's dev workspace, the per-project spine is **carried forward** (copied/continued) into `{slug}-workspace/management_framework/`. Dev-workspace phases (DWG/GCE/TGE) append there, because that workspace is opened on its own and cannot reach the planning-side spine one level up. The planning copy is the planning record; the carried-forward copy is the live build-phase record. Numbering continues per §8. |

## 10. Boundaries (What This Contract Does NOT Do)

1. **Not a package.** Nothing here manages or orchestrates other packages. It is a shared artifact contract only.
2. **Does not replace ADRs or the Architecture_Workbook.** AI-ADLC still records architecture decisions as ADRs; the Decision_Log captures only sub-threshold decisions (unchanged).
3. **Does not enforce compliance.** Runtime governance hooks/rules remain AI-GCE's responsibility.
4. **Not portfolio governance.** Managing many projects is AI-PPM (idea 007).
5. **Does not hardcode location.** WHERE the spine lives is always the user's choice.
6. **Dashboards hub.** The `management_framework/dashboards/` folder is governed by a separate sibling contract (`DASHBOARD_FRAMEWORK_CONTRACT.md` v1.1.0). In the multi-project model each project carries its own `dashboards/` inside its per-project spine; portfolio-level dashboards live at the workspace `pdlc-ws/portfolio/` area. The governance **registers** (Decision_Log, Change_Log, etc.) remain scoped per this contract's §5 — one consolidated spine per project. See `DASHBOARD_FRAMEWORK_CONTRACT.md` §2 for the per-project vs portfolio layouts.
