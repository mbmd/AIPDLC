## What Is This?

The AI-* PDLC Family is part of **AIFLC** (AI Full Life Cycle) — a suite of **injectable workflow packages** that guide AI coding assistants through professional software delivery — from idea through architecture, workspace setup, governance, and test accountability.

Each package is a set of markdown files you drop into your IDE workspace. The AI reads them and gains structured expertise: it knows what to ask, what to produce, and when to hand off to the next package in the chain. No plugins, no APIs, no vendor lock-in.

**Think of it as:** Professional process knowledge, packaged so an AI assistant can execute it with human oversight at every gate.

```
╔════════════════ PORTFOLIO LAYER · scope = MANY projects ════════════════╗

   (optional)
    AI-ILC  ⇢  AI-PILC  ⇢  AI-PPM
    Decide it   Initiate it   Govern it (portfolio of N projects)

## Packages

| Layer | Package | Type | What It Does |
|-------|---------|------|--------------|
| Portfolio | [AI-ILC](./ai-ilc/) | Interactive workflow | Evaluate raw ideas → Approved Idea Brief |
| Portfolio | [AI-PILC](./ai-pilc/) | Interactive workflow | Raw requirement → Project Initiation Package (PIP) |
| Portfolio | [AI-PPM](./ai-ppm/) | Adaptive portfolio engine | Multiple PIPs → Portfolio governance & prioritization |
| Edge | [AI-FLO](./ai-flo/) | Router / orchestration engine | Package-to-package flow orchestration |
| Project | [AI-ADLC](./ai-adlc/) | Interactive workflow | Requirements → Architecture Package (AP) |
| Project | [AI-UXD](./ai-uxd/) | Interactive workflow | PIP/AP → UX Design Package (personas, flows, design system) |
| Project | [AI-POLC](./ai-polc/) | Interactive workflow | PIP/AP → Product Backlog Package (PBP) |
| Project | [AI-DWG](./ai-dwg/) | One-time generator | AP + PBP + UXP → Ready-to-code workspace |
| Project | [AI-GCE](./ai-gce/) | Adaptive governance engine | Workspace → Compliance enforcement layer |
| Project | [AI-TGE](./ai-tge/) | Test governance engine | Workspace → Test strategy, register, coverage tracking |

> **AI-DLC v1** ([awslabs/aidlc-workflows](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows)) is NOT part of this suite — it's Amazon's open-source build lifecycle. Our chain produces the workspace AI-DLC v1 consumes.
>
> **AI-DFE** ([Data Fabric Engine](./ai-dfe/)) is a family-scoped **companion** — it gathers data from all packages and distributes structured JSON for dashboards and status roll-ups. It runs alongside the chain rather than as a linear step, so it is not shown as a chain row above.

## Quick Start

### 1. Pick a starting point

- **New project from scratch?** Start with [AI-PILC](./ai-pilc/) (project initiation)
- **Have requirements, need architecture?** Start with [AI-ADLC](./ai-adlc/)
- **Have architecture, need a workspace?** Start with [AI-DWG](./ai-dwg/)
- **Have an idea to evaluate?** Start with [AI-ILC](./ai-ilc/)
- **Managing multiple projects?** Start with [AI-PPM](./ai-ppm/)

### 2. Install only what you need

**Use the interactive installer** to pick packages and have them placed in the right location for your platform:

```powershell
# Windows
.\installer\install.ps1

# macOS / Linux
./installer/install.sh
```

Or install manually — packages are **independently installable**. You decide how many to run:

- **Solo** — install a single package on its own. Each one is fully self-contained and produces complete, professional output without any other package present.
- **Selective family** — install any subset that fits your work. The chain is modular, so combinations like `AI-PILC + AI-ADLC`, `AI-ADLC + AI-DWG`, or `AI-GCE + AI-TGE` work without requiring the packages in between. When a package detects a sibling's output markers, it enriches its own work with that context; when it doesn't, it runs standalone.
- **Full family** — install the whole chain for end-to-end coverage from idea to test accountability.

Install each package one at a time — adding a package never requires reinstalling the others.

### 3. Each package picks its own AI platform

Compatibility is **per package, not suite-wide**. Every package ships its own `kiro-setup/INSTALL.md` with platform-specific setup, so you can run different packages on different assistants in the same workspace if you want. Supported targets per package:

- **Kiro** (VS Code-based)
- **Amazon Q Developer**
- **Cursor**
- **Claude Code**
- **Cline** (VS Code extension)
- **GitHub Copilot** (⚠️ partial — workspace-level instructions only)

Each INSTALL.md documents the exact destination paths for that platform. The general pattern is the same everywhere: place the package's `*-rules/core-workflow.md` where your AI reads always-loaded steering, and place the `*-rule-details/` folder where the workflow can resolve it on demand. See the [Compatibility](#compatibility) table below for the full matrix.

### 4. Use

Open your IDE chat and tell the AI to use the package:

```
Using AI-PILC, help me initiate this project from my requirements
```

The AI reads the package's core workflow, adopts the appropriate professional role, and guides you through each stage with gates for your approval.

## ⚠️ Brownfield Deployment Warning

If you are injecting packages into an **existing project** (brownfield), please take the following precautions:

1. **Back up first.** Commit all work to version control or take a snapshot before injection.
2. **Use a test branch.** Try the package in an isolated branch before applying to your main codebase.
3. **Review output structure.** Each package documents what it generates — check for conflicts with your existing files and folders.
4. **No warranty.** This software is provided "AS IS" under Apache 2.0. The author accepts no liability for overwritten files, broken pipelines, lost data, or any other damage resulting from integration into existing environments. You are solely responsible for determining appropriateness.

See [LICENSE](./LICENSE) and [NOTICE](./NOTICE) for full liability and warranty disclaimer details.

## Key Design Principles

- **Human-in-the-loop.** Every stage has an approval gate. The AI proposes; you decide.
- **Injectable.** Drop files into any workspace. No plugins, no lock-in.
- **Professional quality.** Each package embeds domain expertise (PMO, CTO, DevOps, QA). Output reads as if produced by a senior professional.
- **Chain-aware.** Packages can hand off to each other via state markers. But each works standalone too.
- **Platform-agnostic.** Works with any AI coding assistant that reads workspace files.
- **Adaptive depth.** Three tiers (Minimal / Standard / Comprehensive) adapt to project complexity.
- **Generic.** Zero project-specific content. Works for any project, any domain, any technology.

## Use Them Together or Alone

**Full chain** (maximum value): AI-ILC → AI-PILC → AI-POLC → AI-UXD → AI-ADLC → AI-DWG → AI-GCE + AI-TGE → AI-DLC v1 (build)

**Standalone** (each package works independently):
- AI-PILC alone produces a professional Project Initiation Package
- AI-ADLC alone produces a complete Architecture Package
- AI-DWG alone generates a workspace from any architecture document
- AI-GCE alone derives governance for any existing workspace
- AI-TGE alone assesses test coverage against architectural commitments

When used in the chain, each package detects its predecessor's output markers and enriches its own work with that context. When used standalone, it gracefully handles missing predecessors.

## Compatibility

| Platform | Supported | Install Guide |
|----------|:---------:|:-------------:|
| Kiro | ✅ | Each package's `kiro-setup/INSTALL.md` |
| Amazon Q Developer | ✅ | Each package's `kiro-setup/INSTALL.md` |
| Cursor | ✅ | Each package's `kiro-setup/INSTALL.md` |
| Cline | ✅ | Each package's `kiro-setup/INSTALL.md` |
| Claude Code | ✅ | Each package's `kiro-setup/INSTALL.md` |
| GitHub Copilot | ⚠️ Partial | Each package's `kiro-setup/INSTALL.md` (workspace-level instructions only) |
| Any other platform | ✅ | Universal Setup section in each `INSTALL.md` |

> Compatibility is per package — every package ships the same platform coverage. For unlisted IDEs, follow the **Universal Setup** steps: place `core-workflow.md` where your AI reads always-loaded steering and `*-rule-details/` where the workflow can resolve it.
