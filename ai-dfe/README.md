## What Is AI-DFE?

AI-DFE is the data layer of the AI-* PDLC Family. It gathers the scattered markdown outputs every package produces, shapes them into structured JSON per consumer needs, and distributes them to one read-point — so dashboards, extensions, and reports get clean, machine-readable data without ever knowing where the raw files live.

**In one sentence:** AI-DFE turns the family's scattered, human-readable outputs into a single governed, machine-readable data surface — gather, shape, distribute.

**Tagline:** *Fabric it.*

---

## Family Position

AI-DFE is part of **AIFLC** (AI Full Life Cycle) and the **AI-* PDLC Family**. Like AI-FLO, it lives in **every family** as a continuous adaptive engine — but where FLO routes decisions, DFE fabrics data. It owns one folder, `pdlc-ws/data/`, and is its sole writer.

> ¹ **AI-DLC v1** ([awslabs/aidlc-workflows](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows)) is NOT our product. Our chain produces the workspace AI-DLC v1 consumes.
> ² **AI-ILC** is an **optional pre-stage** (the funnel before the funnel). The chain still works without it for users who start at AI-PILC. `⇢` denotes the optional link.
> ³ All packages in this table are **built**. AI-PPM (portfolio engine), AI-FLO (router), AI-POLC (product ownership lifecycle), and AI-UXD (UX design lifecycle) were the last four — completed June 2026. Within the Project layer, **AI-POLC, AI-UXD, and AI-ADLC run sequentially** (POLC→UXD→ADLC) — each feeds the next, culminating at AI-DWG which receives all three outputs (AP + PBP + UXP). **AI-GCE and AI-TGE run alongside AI-DLC v1** as continuous quality engines; **AI-POLC ⇄ AI-DLC v1** exchange backlog/acceptance throughout delivery; and **AI-DLC v1 runtime feedback flows back to both AI-UXD and AI-POLC**. Feedback loops (ADLC→POLC cost/risk, ADLC→UXD constraints) provide iterative refinement without changing the forward sequence.

> **Note on AI-DFE's table row:** AI-DFE is a continuous data-fabric engine that operates *alongside* the whole family (like AI-FLO, it is not a chain link). Its formal row is added to the canonical family table during family-governance integration; the diagram and table above are reproduced verbatim from the family canonical (`FAMILY_TABLE_MAP.md`) and are never improvised.

## Features

- **3 phases** — Configure (discover) → Operate (gather, shape, distribute, monitor) → Govern (validate, freshness, history, cleanup)
- **Two-layer pipeline** — sources → per-package JSON (Layer 1) → demand-shaped consumer output (Layer 2)
- **Single-writer territory** — DFE is the sole owner and sole writer of `pdlc-ws/data/`
- **Discover-once, monitor-continuously** — reads each package's interface once, then only checks timestamps
- **Consumer decoupling** — consumers declare a DEMAND; they never touch raw source files
- **REGISTRY.json discovery** — every consumer reads ONE fixed path to find all its data
- **Schema-first** — every data file validates against a JSON Schema (per-package + DFE-owned aggregations)
- **Historical snapshots** — millisecond-timestamped history with retention + cleanup
- **Graceful degradation** — a missing source becomes a `null` field, never an error
- **Multi-family ready** — single-active master mode for operating several families' data from one seat (deferred until a 2nd family exists)
- **`DAT__` operations trigger** — gather/shape/distribute/discover/aggregate/cleanup/master
- **`DHC__` data-fabric health check** — bootstrap readiness check ("can DFE operate in this workspace?"); the data-layer analogue of AI-FLO's `FHC__`. Run it first. Read-only.
- **`DFA__` data-fabric integrity agent** — standalone integrity pass, 18 checks across 5 categories (schema / registry / manifest / freshness / territory); the data-layer analogue of AI-FLO's `FIA__`. Reports, never writes.
- **Hook-free governance** — convention + sole-writer ownership + agent, no IDE hooks

## Activation

**Explicit key:** type `_DFE_` in any prompt to activate AI-DFE unambiguously — even when other AI-* packages share the workspace. The status key `_ACTIVE_` reports which package is currently active. A package switch never happens without your explicit key or confirmation, and any switch is announced on the first line of the response (`Active package: AI-DFE`). See [`../TRIGGER_KEYS_REFERENCE.md`](../TRIGGER_KEYS_REFERENCE.md) for the full family key table.

**Operations:** `DAT__` runs data operations (e.g. `DAT__ all`, `DAT__ pdlc/pilc`, `DAT__ status`). **Quality:** `DFA__` runs the data-fabric quality agent (report-only).

---

## Installation

See `setup/INSTALL.md` for full multi-platform installation instructions.

**Quick start (Kiro):**
1. Copy `ai-dfe-rules/` to your workspace `.kiro/steering/pdlc/`
2. Copy `ai-dfe-rule-details/` to `.kiro/pdlc/`
3. The installer bootstraps an empty `pdlc-ws/data/`; run `DAT__ all` to populate it.

---

## Usage

1. Open a workspace where AI-* packages have produced output
2. Start a chat and run the data trigger:
   ```
   DAT__ all
   ```
3. AI-DFE gathers data from every installed package, shapes it per consumer demands, and distributes structured JSON to `{family}-ws/data/`
4. Use `DAT__ full` for a complete-set pass with a readiness report, `DAT__ status` for a staleness check, or `DFA__` for a report-only quality assessment
5. Consumers (e.g. the dashboard) read the data via `REGISTRY.json`

## Tenets

1. **Generated, not hand-edited** — everything in `data/` is tool-produced.
2. **Single-writer** — only DFE writes to `data/`; any consumer may read.
3. **Schema-first** — no data file without a schema.
4. **Consumers are decoupled** — they declare a DEMAND and read the registry; they never reach into source files.
5. **Family-scoped** — each family owns its own `data/`; cross-family exchange reads the neighbour's data, never mixes.
6. **Graceful degradation** — incomplete is allowed; broken is not.
